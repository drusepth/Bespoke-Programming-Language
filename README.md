An *identifier* must start with a letter, followed by any number of letters or
underscores. Multiple spoken words will be joined by underscores (i.e. "the sum"
will be represented as "the_sum" as an identifier). 

An *integer constant* is a sequence of one or more digits, optionally preceded
by the word "positive" or "negative". Integer constants should be preceded by
the words "the number" (such as "the number 4" or "the number negative three").

A string constant must be preceded by the words "the string" and is a sequence
of any number of letters.

Also, as the language is meant to be spoken aloud, all "ums" and "uhs" will be
ignored.
